#### JOB PLACES

- JABIL

Domain in different equipment of test board (PCBA) analysis and understanding about
process for test like ICT3070 (In-Circuit Test), Teradyne, support to line manufactory
resolution of different issue, I use measuring devices like multimeter and knowledge in
board diagnostic for validate the possible problems about the equipment in the case that
the test is failure, prevention actions y and corrective maintenance

Domain in different measuring devices like oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer, X-ray
(Dage) multimeter, signal generator, power supply, knowledge in radiofrequency (RF)
I was in Nokia project with different tasks, I realize any documents writing solutions
for hard debugs applicated to the boards and I domain, digital and analogic and I can
work under pression.
